PCB:

The PCB can be sourced from ExpressPCB.  

The "ProtoPro" service gives you a 2 sided board with soldermask and 
silkscreening.  4 boards will cost just under $200.  

The "Standard" service gives you a perfectly functional 2 sided board with no 
soldermasks or silkscreening.  2 boards will cost about $100.

If I get sufficient interest, I'll make boards available for $40 each.

Instructions: 

- Download their software from http://www.expresspcb.com/ if you don't already 
have it.
- Open the ./PCB/music_maker.sch file
- From the 'Layout' menu, select "Compute Board Cost" to see your options
  and then "Order Boards via the Internet" to order.


ENCLOSURE:

The front and back panels of the acrylic enclosure can be sourced from Pololu. 
It should cost around $40.

Instructions:

- Go to http://www.pololu.com/catalog/product/749 and click "Request a Quote"
- Upload the ./parts/music_maker_panels.dxf file, fill in a quantity and
  any special instructions, select a material, and wait for them to email you 
  a quote.  You can place the order at that point.
